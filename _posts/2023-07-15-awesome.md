# awesome lists

This is one of the most useful resources I've come across on the internet. I was searching for open-source apps for my phone. While browsing YouTube videos and blogs, I noticed many listicles and articles featuring mediocre apps or worse, paid ones. However, somehow I stumbled upon a GitHub page with a simple bullet-point list of the apps I needed. It was even subdivided into different categories. It was an "aha!" moment.

I then discovered that there's a whole community behind these lists. Everyone creates their own and shares them online. There are websites that curate lists of lists. It's fantastic. [Check this one](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) or [this one](https://www.trackawesomelist.com/) or just check [*awesome* topic on Github](https://github.com/topics/awesome).

You can find these lists for many useful topics. Instead of wasting time on search engines, you can find an "awesome" list for that subject and directly learn what you need.

It's not an end-all solution, but it gets you started. I may have spent too much time on these lists not on search results; and I've learned a lot. I want to share some of the lists I really appreciated.
