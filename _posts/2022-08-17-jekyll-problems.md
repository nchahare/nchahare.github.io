All I wanted is to have a website with simple navigation bar pointing to my blog, my CV, and my publications. I used jekyll and minimal mistakes theme to make the webpage. Earlier everything was well with the webpage.

## Navigation bar and Hamburger menu

I added an extra section in the navigation called media. With this the bar became more crowded and there was no more space to accommodate all options. The hamburger menu appeared automatically. Amazing right? No. When I changed the order of the pages, it stopped working and now the hamburger menu has been disabled. Even though I have changed nothing. The options were going into the Home button and disappearing. I had to change the name of sections so that they can fit in mobile devices.

Online people were saying that this is the problem of jekyll not the theme.

## Follow menu

This is when I realize somethings up with the follow button which appears after resizing the screen or in mobile. Yesterday it worked perfectly. Today it has stopped.


Again, jekyll is blamed for this. I am too clueless to solve this problem.

Only solution I see is to retry building the website and hope it works.
