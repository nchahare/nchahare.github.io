Pub crawls, bar tours, or the delightful practice of "bap-hopping" are quite common, and perhaps it's a European thing. There’s something undeniably fun about roaming the city with friends and indulging in a few drinks. I’ve experienced it myself, often focusing on the culinary side of things. Take my 'ruta del sants,' for instance: it started with beers after work at Centre Cívic Can Deu, followed by a stroll to another bar for some delicious patates montreal paired with a pint of Budvar. Then, we’d continue our walk to Plaça d'Osca for a proper dinner, which might lead us to cocktails or shots of ratafia. I cherish so many beautiful memories of this city, and it’s bittersweet to think I’ll be leaving it soon. I will really miss my friends and the vibes of Barcelona.

It's already been a few years since I moved to Sant Gervasi, a neighborhood in Barcelona known for many things, but what I found incredible is that the local bars serve some of the best bravas in the city. They’ve been winning awards year after year! I’ve also noticed that people are indulging in "corretapas," where you hop from bar to bar trying different tapas—similar to bar-hopping but with a focus on delicious bites.

This inspired me to create a "**correbraves**," where I organized a route of bars that have won awards for the best bravas or have been featured in newspapers for their exceptional offerings. I shared the idea over lunch, and it quickly gained traction! As a group, we decided on the following must-visit spots:

1. Bar Tomás de Sarrià
2. Bar Marcel Santalo
3. Bar Omar
4. Wherever the night takes us! 

Let the adventure begin!

### Bar Tomás de Sarrià

We kicked off our evening at Bar Tomás with a large group, and let me tell you, arriving early is key! The weather was less than ideal—rainy and dreary—but we trudged our way from the lab. Upon arrival, we faced the quintessential Barcelona dilemma: finding enough seats for a big group at a popular bar. It’s quite the hassle, but we managed to snag a table for eight to ten people. We indulged in patatas bravas and beers, and I have to say, this place is my favorite! It boasts that classic old Catalan neighborhood bar vibe, complete with a grumpy waiter. The sauce was delicious, and the bravas were perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. This gem has been making headlines, and I can see why—it truly deserves all the accolades! After our feast, we hopped on the FGC train to our next destination, Muntaner.

### Bar Marcel Santalo

By the time we reached Bar Marcel Santalo, the rain had intensified, and after 8 PM, finding a spot was nearly impossible. We lost a few folks along the way, but our adventure continued. As expected, the bar was packed, so we decided to grab some takeout bravas and head to my place since I literally lived just across the street. Everyone piled into my home, and I handed out forks—thankfully, I had just enough! Some found the takeout experience a bit underwhelming, but I enjoyed it. Sure, it wasn't the same as dining in, and the sauces ended up all over the place, but the best part was at the bottom of the container. Just when it seemed like we might call it a night, the enthusiasm kicked in, and we decided to push forward!

### Bar Omar

Next up was Bar Omar, another spot known for its accolades and a reputation as a fancier restaurant. We knew it would be a tight squeeze for our group, but we gave it a shot anyway. We asked the waiter if we could eat standing outside, and placed our order for the exquisite bravas from Sant Gervasi. The waiter brought us small plates of bravas drizzled with sauce, featuring a flame-kissed butifarra. They were absolutely incredible! I was thrilled we could experience this. It was unanimously decided that Bar Omar had the best bravas around. The rain had let up, and despite losing a few more people, our motivation for some real food kept us going.

### Not Bravas at Byblos

I then led the group to our next neighborhood favorite, Byblos. They serve the best Lebanese shawarma in Barcelona, and it’s super affordable—just what we needed! We grabbed more beers, more food, and even some delightful Middle Eastern sweets. Nights like these, where you never know where you’ll end up, are absolutely amazing!

### Conclusion at Bar La Cava

I truly love this neighborhood, even if it has a reputation for being upscale and catering to the wealthy. There are plenty of cool bars and restaurants that won’t break the bank. I had my heart set on a jugatería, but when we arrived, people were hesitant to go in, thinking it was just for teenagers and not suitable for us. So, I shrugged it off and suggested another spot. We ended up at Bar La Cava, a place known for being perpetually closed, but it was open that night! We enjoyed 5-euro cocktails and had two fantastic bartenders serving us. Amid great conversations and full bellies, we wrapped up the night, already excited about planning more adventures like this in the future.
