Completing my PhD in Barcelona was a significant achievement and I wanted to share this with my parents, but the visa situation prevented my parents from being there for my defense. Determined to include them in this milestone, I decided to write a summary of my research in Marathi, their native language.

Writing in Marathi after so long, especially about science, was a challenge. I also had no idea how to type in Marathi. A friend suggested using Google Translate, which converted English phonetics into Marathi script. It was a lifesaver.

However, translating scientific terms was tough. My higher education had been in English, and my vocabulary of Marathi lacked the precise terms for cells and tissues. So, I crafted the article especially for my parents, ensuring clarity, using bit of english.

After hours of writing, editing, and revisions, I presented the Marathi summary to my parents. Their reaction was heartwarming. They appreciated the effort and were genuinely proud of my work. 

This experience taught me that language should never hinder sharing our achievements and emotions with our loved ones.
