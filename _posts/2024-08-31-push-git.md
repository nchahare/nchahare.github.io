I can't believe that every 3 months, I forget how to do this. 

Here's how to make the `git push` command work for pushing an existing folder/repository from the command line:

### Step-by-step process:

- Ensure you have initialized your local repository: `git init`
- Add the remote repository: `git remote add origin <url_of_remote_repository>`  
- Here you must recall that it `<url_of_remote_repository>` is typically in following format:  `https://<PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>@github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io.git`
- You can get a classic token from developer's settings in your github page. Tick all the necessary permission boxes. I typically copy paste this code in secure location for future use.
- Add files, commit and push

```git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git remote -v
git push origin master
```

### How to reset token

* If you already had done the above part but now the token has expired. 
* Open terminal in vscode, if you are using vscode to commit and push code.
* Check if all the information is correct by using this command `git config --list`
* Most likely, the token is wrong. So you can set it up again using `git remote set-url origin https://<PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>@github.com/<username>/<repo>.git`
