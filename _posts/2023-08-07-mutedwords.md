X, formerly known as Twitter, is the only social media I use. I enjoy keeping up with scientific developments and following scientists from around the world to see what they're up to.

In these turbulent times, I rely on traditional news sources to stay informed rather than Twitter/X.

It's not surprising that scientists, like everyone else, can sometimes have less-than-ideal opinions about the news. Typically, I simply ignore them. However, if someone becomes particularly annoying or overzealous in their tweeting, I might resort to blocking, unfollowing, or muting them.

Interestingly, thanks to Elon Musk (*sarcasm*), I've stumbled upon the useful feature of muted keywords. You can access it through this link: 
[https://twitter.com/settings/muted_keywords](https://twitter.com/settings/muted_keywords). 
It allows you to filter out tweets containing specific words.

If you are on the phone go to settings --> Privacy and Safety --> Mute and block --> Muted words.

I strongly encourage people to take advantage of this feature by muting keywords they'd rather not see in their feed. With all the strife and misery in the world, there's no need to clutter up Twitter with negativity when we already have the news for that.

As an example, I'm a 30-year-old Indian man, and Twitter seems to think I'm inherently interested in cricket, cricketers, and their personal lives. To address this, I've added the necessary keywords to filter out these tweets. It's been remarkably effective!

I wish you have a wonderful day!
