title: Will be giving couple of talks in November. Very Excited!
---

I am going to be giving two seminars back to back in November. Both Developmental Biology ones. Super excited to show off my PhD work.

One talk will be a part of "International Developmental Mechanics Zoom Seminar Series" on 7th November.

Other talk is an inaugral seminar series ["Gulmohar"](https://x.com/InSDB_79/status/1838189054103560451) on 11th November from Indian Society of Developmental Biology.

I am grateful for these opportunities and hope to make some meaningful connections with Dev-Bio community.
