# Nimesh Chahare, PhD

## Work

I am a **Postdoctoral Research Scientist** at Columbia University, New York City with Prof. Nandan Nerurkar on understanding mechanics of morphogenesis in chick embryos.

I am also a founder and convenor of the **International Epithelial Mechanics Club**, where we are building a community of scientists interested in Epithelial Mechanics and role of mechanical forces in biological contexts. 

## Interests

My research interests are related to mechanobiology in development. This interest stems from my mechanical engineering education and time I spent in  biology labs. This unique experience lets me combine my knowledge of continuum mechanics and material testing with tissue engineering and microfluidics. My PhD created deep interest in cell and tissue dynamics leading to morphogenesis. And it continues to deepen in my Postdoc, where i solve developmental biology problems.
