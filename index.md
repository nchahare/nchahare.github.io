Hi! My name is Nimesh Chahare. I am trained as a mechanical engineer and also have a PhD in Applied Mathematics. Now, I am doing a postdoc where I try to understand mechancis of brain development. Throughout my research, I have been developing technologies to probe the mechanics of biology. In the future, I would like to explore emergent mechanical phenomena in cellular collectives.
