Hello! My name is Nimesh Chahare. Welcome to my corner of the internet!

This is where I share things I do and think about.

I'm a scientist, mechanical engineer, amateur artist, and much more. Check my portfolio/CV.

Currently, I work as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Columbia University's Biomedical Engineering department in New York City. My research focuses on understanding how mechanical forces drive morphogenesis, particularly in the early embryonic brain.

My background is in mechanical engineering and materials science. Living tissues as a material fascinate me the most. My PhD was on understanding the mechanics of epithelial tissues and exploring novel ways to engineer them. Interested? Read my thesis.

I'm quite passionate about epithelial mechanics. In fact, I'm the convenor of the International Epithelial Mechanics Fan Club. It's a small community I started for those who share my interest. Join us!

I like learning new things, hanging out with people, reading books, cooking curries, making origami, and walking around the city. I try to share these interests on my blog. Please feel free to get in touch with me!
