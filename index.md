Hello! My name is [Nimesh Chahare](). Welcome to my corner of the internet!

This is where I share things I do and think about.

I'm a scientist, engineer, amateur artist, and much more. <br>
Check my [portfolio]()/[CV]().

I'm working as Postdoctoral Scientist at Columbia University in New York City.<br>
My research focuses on mechanics in formation of early embryonic brain.

My background is in mechanical engineering and material science. Living tissues as a material fascinate me the most. My PhD was on understanding the mechanics of epithelial tissues and exploring novel ways to engineer them. <br>
Interested? Read my [thesis]().

On side, I'm the convenor of the International Epithelial Mechanics Fan Club. It's a small community I started for those who share my interest.<br>

I like learning new things, hanging out with people, reading books, cooking curries, making origami, and walking around the city.<br>
I share some of these on [my blog]().<br>
