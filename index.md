Hello! My name is [Nimesh Chahare](/me). Welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm a scientist, engineer, amateur artist, and much more. <br>
Check my [portfolio](/portfolio)/[CV](/cv).

I'm working as Postdoctoral Scientist at [Columbia University](https://nerurkar.bme.columbia.edu/) in New York City.<br>
My research focuses on mechanics in formation of early embryonic brain.

My background is in mechanical engineering and material science. Living tissues as a material fascinate me the most. My PhD at [IBEC Barcelona](https://ibecbarcelona.eu/integrative) was on understanding the mechanics of epithelial tissues and exploring novel ways to engineer them. Interested? Read my [thesis](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/401551).

On side, I'm the convenor of the [International Epithelial Mechanics Fan Club](https://twitter.com/EpiMechFC). It's a small community I started for those who share my interest. [Join us!](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=EpiMechFC)

I like learning new things, hanging out with people, reading books, cooking curries, making origami, and walking around the city.<br>
I share some of these on [my blog](/journal).<br>
