Hello! My name is <b>Nimesh Chahare</b>.<br> 

I want to understand how living things get their shape. <br> I am a mechanical engineer by training so I try to view biology from the lens of mechanics. I did my PhD in Applied mathematics in Barcelona, where I tried to build 3D tissues in a dish with pressure.<br> Now, in New York, I am at Biomedical engineering, trying to understand how nature builds tissue in a living chicken. I focus on early embryonic brain development. For details check out my portfolio/cv. 

I know! It is very interesting. We can discuss more; contact me via [email](mailto:nimesh.c@columbia.edu).

Plus, I love learning new things. I cook curries; read novels; make origami;<br> or spend way too much time on internet.
