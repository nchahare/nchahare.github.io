Hello! My name is Nimesh Chahare. I want to understand how living things get their shape. I am a mechanical engineer by training so I try to view biology from the lens of mechanics.

I did my PhD in Applied mathematics in Barcelona, where I tried to build 3D tissues in a dish with pressure.

Now, in New York, I am at Biomedical engineering, trying to understand how nature builds tissue in a living chicken. I focus on early embryonic brain development. For details check out my portfolio/cv. 

I know! It is very interesting. We can discuss more; contact me via [email](mailto:nimesh.c@columbia.edu).

Plus, I love learning new things. I read novels; make origami; or spend hours on end diving down internet rabbit holes.
