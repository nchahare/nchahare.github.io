My name is Nimesh R. Chahare (निमेश रमेश चहारे). I am a mechanical engineer working with biological materials based in New York City, US. Throughout my research, I have been developing technologies to probe the mechanics of biology. In the future, I would like to explore emergent mechanical phenomena in cellular collectives.

Please feel free to get in touch with me!

## work

I am currently working with [Prof. Nandan Nerurkar](https://nerurkar.bme.columbia.edu/) on understanding mechanics of morphogenesis in chick embryos. I did my Ph.D. thesis on epithelial mechanics, supervised by [Prof. Xavier Trepat](https://ibecbarcelona.eu/integrative) at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), and [Prof. Marino Arroyo](https://arroyo.lacan.upc.edu/) at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. During my Ph.D. I was looking at the role of mechanical forces such as pressure in development and unraveling the interesting physics behind the biological processes. I achieved it by developing a microfluidic device for engineering the three-dimensional tissues. We were able to perform rheological studies on epithelial tissues to understand the role of actin cytoskeleton. Along the way, we discovered tissue buckling as a fascinating mode of engineering tissues. You can find my PhD thesis [here](https://nchahare.github.io/thesis/).

I have received my masters degree from Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru and bachelors degree from VNIT Nagpur in Mechanical Engineering. I worked with [Prof. Namrata Gundiah](https://mecheng.iisc.ac.in/namrata/index.html) on all things biomechanics, ranging from single cell mechanobiology to insect mandible physics. This lab experience inspired me to pursue biophysics as line of research.

In my free time, I love learning new things. I read novels; make origami; or spend hours on end diving down internet rabbit holes.
