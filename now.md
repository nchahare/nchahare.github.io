It's been a long, tough year, but still, it went by too fast. 
I quit my job in Barcelona and moved to New York.
I had to do this with my partner. Luckily, it all worked out. We both found a job and housing.
I'm a postdoc at Columbia. Lab is small and has no windows, but people are very nice. 
At the same time, I'm finding my footing in this crazy, beautiful city. This city is too diverse.
At work, I'm studying chicken brains. Outside, I got into film photography. Actually, I'm about to quit, as it is too expensive.
I may get into digital photography, but I will get a shitty CCD camera from 20 years ago.
