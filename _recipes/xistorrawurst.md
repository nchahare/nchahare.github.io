One of my favorite culinary adventures was discovering Xistorra Wurst, a delightful fusion of the popular German Currywurst and the flavorful Spanish Xistorra sausage. Combining the spiciness of curry sauce with the smoky, rich taste of Xistorra, this dish opened up a whole new world of flavors for me. It's perfect for a fun, casual meal with friends and family, especially when served with a side of crispy French fries or crusty bread. This creative twist on a classic street food dish is a testament to the endless possibilities that come from combining different culinary traditions.

## ingredients

-   4 xistorra sausages (about 300 grams)
-   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
-   1 cup ketchup
-   1/4 cup water
-   2 tablespoons curry powder
-   1 teaspoon smoked paprika
-   1 teaspoon sugar
-   1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
-   Optional sides: French fries or crusty bread

## steps

1.  In a small saucepan, combine ketchup, water, curry powder, smoked paprika, sugar, and black pepper. Stir well to combine.
2.  Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally. Cook for 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Remove from heat and set aside.
3.  In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium heat.
4.  Add the xistorra sausages to the skillet and cook for 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are evenly browned and fully cooked through.
5.  Remove the sausages from the skillet and allow them to cool slightly. Then, cut the sausages into bite-sized slices.
6.  Pour the warm curry sauce over the sliced xistorra, ensuring all pieces are evenly coated.
7.  Serve your Xistorra Wurst immediately with a side of French fries or crusty bread.
    

**Note**: You can adjust the spiciness and seasoning of the curry sauce to your liking. Feel free to experiment with different spices or adding a splash of hot sauce for an extra kick.
