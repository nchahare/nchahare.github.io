## ingredients

-   2 cups (400 grams) basmati rice
-   3 cups (720 ml) water
-   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
-   1 teaspoon cumin seeds
-   1 large onion, thinly sliced
-   1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
-   1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
-   1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
-   1 teaspoon garam masala
-   Salt, to taste
-   4 cups (about 450 grams) mixed frozen vegetables (such as peas, carrots, corn, green beans, and bell peppers)
-   1/4 cup (10 grams) chopped cilantro (coriander leaves)
-   1/4 cup (10 grams) chopped mint leaves

## steps

1.  Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in 3 cups of water for 20 minutes. Drain the water and set the rice aside.
2.  In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for about 30 seconds.
3.  Add the thinly sliced onions and cook until they turn golden brown.    
4.  Add the ginger-garlic paste and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning.    
5.  Add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Stir well and cook for another minute.    
6.  Add the mixed frozen vegetables to the pot and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are heated through.    
7.  Add the soaked rice to the pot and mix gently, ensuring the rice is evenly coated with the spices.    
8.  Add 3 cups of water and bring the mixture to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.    
9.  Cook the pulao for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the water has been absorbed.    
10.  Remove the pot from the heat and let it rest for 5 minutes with the lid still on. Afterward, gently fluff the rice with a fork.    
11.  Stir in the chopped cilantro and mint leaves.    

Serve your vegetarian pulao with frozen vegetables hot, accompanied by raita, yogurt, or a side salad. Enjoy this flavorful and easy-to-make dish any time you crave a wholesome, satisfying meal.
