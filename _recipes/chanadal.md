Chana dal has been a beloved dish in my family, and we have it all the time. I always shied away from making it myself because of the need to soak the dal and the traditional pressure cooker method. However, this recipe for chana dal without a pressure cooker has become a game-changer for me. It's easy to follow and doesn't require any fancy equipment, making it accessible for even the most novice of cooks. With a perfect blend of spices and tender, delicious dal, this dish has quickly become a favorite in my household. I love pairing it with rice or roti for a satisfying and comforting meal.

## ingredients
- 250g chana dal, rinsed and soaked in water for 30 minutes
- 2 tablespoons oil
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated
- 2-3 green chillies, slit (optional)
- 2 tomatoes, finely chopped (or 1 can of diced tomatoes)
- 1 teaspoon coriander powder
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1/2 teaspoon red chilli powder
- Salt, to taste
- 3 cups water
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander leaves

## steps
- Heat the oil in a deep pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.
- Add the chopped onion and sauté until it turns translucent.
- Add the minced garlic, grated ginger and chopped green chillies (if using) and sauté for a minute.
- Add the chopped tomatoes (or canned tomatoes) and all the spice powders (coriander, turmeric and red chilli). Mix well and cook until the tomatoes become soft and mushy.
- Drain the soaked chana dal and add it to the pot. Mix well and sauté for 2-3 minutes.
- Add 3 cups of water and salt to taste. Mix well and bring to a boil.
- Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a lid and simmer for 45-50 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the dal becomes soft and tender.
- Check the consistency of the dal. If it's too thick, add some water and mix well. If it's too thin, simmer for a few more minutes until it thickens.
- Garnish with chopped fresh coriander leaves and serve hot with rice or roti.
- Enjoy your delicious chana dal!
