# Chicken Biryani Recipe (6 portions) - No Oven, Stovetop Only

I absolutely love Chicken Biryani, and this easy stovetop version brings the authentic taste of India right to my kitchen. While my family in India doesn't traditionally make this dish at home, it has always been one of our favorite orders at restaurants. This simplified recipe allows me to recreate those cherished memories and enjoy the rich, aromatic flavors of Chicken Biryani without the need for an oven or a pressure cooker. It's the perfect dish to share with loved ones, and it never fails to impress with its delightful blend of spices and tender chicken.

## ingredients

-   600 grams chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces
-   2 cups (400 grams) basmati rice
-   1 large onion, thinly sliced
-   1 can (400 grams) diced tomatoes
-   4 cups (960 ml) water
-   4 teaspoons vegetable oil
-   1 teaspoon cumin seeds
-   1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste (or 1/2 teaspoon ginger powder and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder as an alternative)
-   2 teaspoons garam masala
-   1 teaspoon red chili powder
-   1 teaspoon turmeric powder
-   2 teaspoons coriander powder
-   1 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
-   3 cups (720 ml) water, for cooking rice
-   1/2 cup (120 ml) warm milk
-   1/2 teaspoon saffron threads, soaked in the warm milk
-   1/4 cup (10 grams) chopped cilantro
-   1/4 cup (10 grams) chopped mint leaves

## steps

### Marination

1.  In a large bowl, combine chicken pieces, ginger-garlic paste (or ginger and garlic powder), garam masala, red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well to coat the chicken evenly. Set aside for at least 30 minutes.

### Rice Preparation

2.  Rinse basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in 3 cups of water for 20 minutes. Drain the water and set the rice aside.
3.  In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the soaked rice and cook until it's 70% cooked (slightly undercooked). Drain the rice and set aside.
    

### Chicken Biryani

4.  In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for about 30 seconds.
5.  Add the thinly sliced onions and cook until they turn golden brown.
6.  Add the marinated chicken and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7.  Add the diced tomatoes and cook for an additional 10 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the tomatoes are softened.
8.  Layer half of the cooked rice on top of the chicken and tomato mixture.
9.  Drizzle half of the saffron-infused milk over the rice.
10.  Sprinkle half of the chopped cilantro and mint leaves over the rice.
11.  Layer the remaining rice on top.
12.  Drizzle the remaining saffron-infused milk over the rice.
13.  Sprinkle the remaining chopped cilantro and mint leaves over the top layer of rice.
14.  Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot tightly with a lid or with aluminum foil to seal in the steam.
15.  Cook the biryani on low heat for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the flavors have melded together.
16.  Carefully remove the lid or aluminum foil and gently fluff the biryani with a fork before serving.
    

Serve your stovetop chicken biryani hot with raita or your choice of side dishes. Enjoy!
