## ingredients
For 4 portions
- 500g baby spinach
- 500g potatoes chopped
- 4tsp sunflower oil
- 2tsp cumin seeds
- A pinch of asafoetida
- 3 onions chopped
- 2tsp ginger powder
- 2tsp garlic paste
- 1.5tsp red chili powder
- 1tsp salt
- 0.5tsp garam masala
- 1tsp coriander powder
- 0.5tsp turmeric powder
- A few drops of lemon juice

## steps

- Wash the spinach leaves well
- Heat a nonstick pan over medium flame. Add the spinach to the pan. Soon it will start wilting and start releasing water. Let the water evaporate and stir. Or forget about it and microwave some frozen spinach!
- Once the spinach is cooked move it to a dish aside
- In the same pan, add oil
- Add cumin seeds. Let them sputter. Now add asafoetida
- Then add chopped onion to fry it till it is golden brown
- Add garlic, ginger, and chili, salt one by one
- Add all the dry spices coriander powder, garam masala, and turmeric powder
- Now add the cubed potatoes and mix.
- Cook the potatoes on medium heat for 5-6 minutes with the lid on. Keep stirring. If you use boiled potatoes then you don't need to leave them this long
- When potatoes are almost done and add spinach. Mix it well. Let it cook for 5min more. If the curry is looking too dry add water and let it evaporate
- Finally, squeeze in some fresh lemon juice and enjoy!
