description:  Sobrassada Quesadilla with Queso Tierno

Judith and I often make Sobrassada Quesadillas for dinner, as we both share a love for the rich and flavorful sobrassada. These quesadillas are not only easy to prepare, but they also offer the perfect opportunity to get creative with the fillings. We enjoy experimenting with different ingredients like sautéed onions, bell peppers, or even jalapeños for an extra kick. This versatile and mouthwatering dish never fails to impress our taste buds, making it a fun and satisfying meal for any occasion.

Please refer to the [author's notes](https://nchahare.github.io/blog/2022/cooking/) if this is your first time here.

## ingredients

-   4 store-bought Mexican tortillas (preferably corn tortillas)
-   200 grams sobrassada, thinly sliced or crumbled
-   200 grams queso tierno, grated or thinly sliced
-   1 tablespoon vegetable oil or butter, for cooking
-   Optional toppings: sliced avocado, sour cream, or salsa

## steps

1. Place one tortilla on a plate.     
2. Spread an even layer of sobrassada on the tortilla, covering half of the surface.    
3. Add a layer of queso tierno on top of the sobrassada.    
4. Fold the tortilla in half, creating a half-moon shape, and gently press the edges to seal.    
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for the remaining tortillas.
6. Heat a large non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add vegetable oil or butter to the skillet.  
7. Carefully place the quesadillas in the skillet, leaving some space between them to prevent sticking. You may need to cook them in batches.   
8. Cook the quesadillas for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the tortilla is golden brown and crispy, and the cheese is melted.
9. Remove the quesadillas from the skillet and let them rest for a minute before cutting into wedges.    
10. Serve hot with your choice of toppings, such as sliced avocado, sour cream, chopped cilantro, or salsa.

**Note**: You can adjust the amount of sobrassada and queso tierno according to your preference. Feel free to get creative with additional fillings, like sautéed onions, bell peppers, or jalapeños for an extra kick.
