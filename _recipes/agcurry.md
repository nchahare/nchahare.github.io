## ingredients
For 4 portions
- 500g cauliflower (I am using frozen one, you can use fresh one if you want)
- 5 potatoes medium sized
- 4tsp sunflower oil
- 2tsp cumin seeds
- A pinch of asafoetida
- 3 onions chopped
- 2tsp ginger powder
- 2tsp garlic paste
- 1.5tsp red chili powder
- 1tsp salt
- 0.5tsp garam masala
- 1tsp coriander powder
- 0.5tsp turmeric powder
- 400g of canned tomato
- A few drops of lemon juice

## steps

- Cook the cauliflower by boiling it.
- Once cauliflower is cooked, cut it into small pieces
- Add oil and then add cumin seeds. Let them sputter. Now add asafoetida
- Then add chopped onion to fry it till it is golden brown
- Add garlic, ginger, and chili, salt one by one
- Add tomato and mix it well
- Add all the dry spices coriander powder, garam masala, and turmeric powder
- Now add the cubed potatoes and mix.
- Cook the potatoes on medium heat for 5-6 minutes with the lid on. Keep stirring. If you use boiled potatoes then you don't need to leave it this long
- When potatoes are almost done and add cauliflower. Mix it well. Let it cook for 5min more. If the curry is looking too dry add water and let it evaporate
- Finally, squeeze in some fresh lemon juice and enjoy!
