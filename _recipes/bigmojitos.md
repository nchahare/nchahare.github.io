Almost every year, my boss invites the entire lab for a mojito pool party. We prepare a large batch of mojitos with 2 liters of rum. It's quite fun; we all pitch in to cut limes and make ice. This year, I made the mojitos with some incredible muddlers.

The only thing you have to remember when making this drink is to muddle very well and extensively.

If you want to make a large quantity of mojitos with 2 liters of rum, you have scale up the ingredients accordingly. Here's a recipe for a batch of mojitos:


Ingredients:
- 2 liters of white rum
- 35 limes, cut into wedges
- 285.5 gm of sugar (adjust to taste)
- 30 fresh mint sprigs
- Crushed ice
- 3.5 liters Soda water (club soda)

Instructions:
1. In a large container or pitcher, combine the lime wedges and sugar.
2. Use a muddler or the back of a spoon to gently muddle the limes and sugar to release the lime juice.
3. Add the fresh mint leaves to the container and gently muddle them to release their aroma. Make sure to bruise them properly.
4. Add three quarters full ice in the container.
5. Pour in the 2 liters of white rum and stir the mixture well.
6. Add 2 liters (for strong), 3.5 liters (for okay) of soda water to the mixture 
7. Serve your large batch of mojitos to your guests and enjoy responsibly!
