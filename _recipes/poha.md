# Aloo Kanda Poha Recipe (Potato and Onion Flattened Rice)

Aloo Kanda Poha is a popular Indian breakfast dish, particularly in Maharashtra, made with flattened rice (poha), potatoes, and onions. It's a simple, wholesome, and flavorful meal that's easy to prepare. I have very fond memories of eating poha all the time. It was a staple food my mother would make for guests. I like this dish a lot.

## ingredients

-   2 cups (200 grams) thick poha (flattened rice)
-   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
-   1 teaspoon mustard seeds
-   1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
-   1/4 teaspoon asafoetida (hing)
-   1 medium onion, finely chopped (kanda)
-   1 large potato, peeled and chopped into small cubes (aloo)
-   2-3 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to taste)
-   8-10 curry leaves
-   1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
-   Salt, to taste
-   1 teaspoon sugar (optional)
-   2 tablespoons chopped cilantro (coriander leaves)
-   1 tablespoon lemon juice
-   2 tablespoons grated coconut (optional, for garnish)
-   2 tablespoons roasted peanuts (optional, for garnish)

## steps

1.  Place the poha in a colander and rinse it gently with water. Be careful not to break the flakes. Drain the water and let the poha sit in the colander for 10-15 minutes to soften and absorb any remaining moisture.
    
2.  In a large pan or wok, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the mustard seeds and allow them to crackle. Then add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.
    
3.  Add the asafoetida, followed by the chopped onion. Cook the onion until it becomes soft and translucent.
    
4.  Add the chopped potato and cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the potato is cooked through and tender.
    
5.  Add the green chilies and curry leaves, and cook for 1-2 minutes.
    
6.  Add the turmeric powder, salt, and sugar (if using). Mix well and cook for another minute.
    
7.  Add the soaked poha to the pan and mix gently, ensuring the poha is evenly coated with the spices.
    
8.  Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the poha is heated through and the flavors meld together.
    
9.  Turn off the heat and stir in the chopped cilantro and lemon juice.
    
10.  Garnish with grated coconut and roasted peanuts, if desired.
