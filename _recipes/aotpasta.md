A variation of a famous aglio-olio pasta. I have added tuna, peppers and onions to make sauce thick. Added tons of olive oil to make my favourite pasta recipe. It all can be done within 25min (including cleaning time).  

Please refer to the [author's notes](https://nchahare.github.io/blog/2022/cooking/) if this is your first time here.

## steps
