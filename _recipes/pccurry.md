After eating spinach combined with chickpeas, cheese, and potatoes many times, I found myself longing for a new twist on the leafy green vegetable. That's when I stumbled upon the idea of using corn instead. I had seen it in some online recipes and even tried it at a few restaurants. The addition of sweet corn to the dish seemed like the perfect way to mix things up and add some variety to my usual meals. That's how I discovered spinach corn curry, a flavorful and healthy dish that quickly became a favorite in my household.

## ingredients
-   500g fresh spinach, washed and chopped (frozen can be used too)
-   2 cups of frozen corn kernels
-   1 large onion, chopped
-   3 garlic cloves, minced (can use powder too)
-   2-inch piece of ginger, grated
-   3-4 green chillies, chopped (optional)
-   3 tomatoes, chopped (or 400gm can)
-   2 teaspoons cumin seeds
-   2 teaspoons coriander powder
-   1 teaspoon turmeric powder
-   1 teaspoon red chilli powder
-   2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
-   4 tablespoons oil
-   1 teaspoon Garam Masala
-   Water, as needed

## steps

1.  Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.
2.  Add the chopped onion and sauté until it turns translucent.
3.  Add the minced garlic, grated ginger and chopped green chillies (if using) and sauté for a minute.
4.  Add the chopped tomatoes, salt and all the spice powders (coriander, turmeric and red chilli). Mix well and cook until the tomatoes become soft and mushy.
5.  Add the chopped spinach and corn kernels to the pan. Mix well and cook until the spinach wilts and the corn kernels become tender.
6.  Add water as needed to adjust the consistency of the curry. Bring the curry to a boil and then let it simmer for 5-10 minutes.
7.  Check the seasoning and adjust if needed.
8.  Add Garam masala at the end.
