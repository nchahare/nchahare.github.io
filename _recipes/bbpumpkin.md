## ingredients

-   500 grams pumpkin, peeled, deseeded, and cubed
-   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
-   1 teaspoon mustard seeds
-   1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
-   1/4 teaspoon asafoetida (hing)
-   1 medium onion, finely chopped
-   2-3 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to taste)
-   1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste
-   1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
-   1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
-   Salt, to taste
-   2 tablespoons grated coconut (fresh or desiccated)
-   2 tablespoons chopped cilantro (coriander leaves)
-   1 tablespoon lemon juice

## steps

1.  In a large pot, add the cubed pumpkin and enough water to cover the pumpkin. Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the pumpkin is soft and cooked through. Drain the water and let the pumpkin cool slightly. Then, mash the pumpkin with a fork or potato masher and set aside.
    
2.  In a pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the mustard seeds and allow them to crackle. Then add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.
    
3.  Add the asafoetida, followed by the chopped onion. Cook the onion until it becomes soft and translucent.
    
4.  Add the green chilies and ginger-garlic paste, and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning.
    
5.  Add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for another minute.
    
6.  Add the mashed pumpkin to the pan and mix well to combine all the ingredients. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and the flavors meld together.
    
7.  Add the grated coconut and chopped cilantro, and mix well. Cook for another 2 minutes.
    
8.  Turn off the heat and stir in the lemon juice.
