When I first tried Dal Chicken in a Pakistani restaurant in Barcelona, I had no idea such a delightful dish even existed. The combination of tender chicken breast and protein-packed chana dal, infused with a medley of fragrant spices, truly tantalized my taste buds. This hearty and aromatic meal allowed me to experience the rich culinary culture of Pakistan and opened my eyes to the diverse and unique flavors it has to offer. It's amazing how food can transport us across borders and bring us closer to different cultures!

## ingredients

-   500 grams chicken breast, cubed
-   200 grams chana dal, soaked for at least 2 hours
-   1 large onion, finely chopped
-   2 cloves garlic, minced
-   1-inch piece ginger, minced
-   1 can (400 grams) diced tomatoes
-   4 cups water
-   4 teaspoons vegetable oil
-   2 teaspoons cumin seeds
-   1 teaspoon turmeric powder
-   2 teaspoons coriander powder
-   1 teaspoon garam masala
-   1 teaspoon red chili powder
-   2 teaspoons salt
-   2 teaspoons fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)

## steps

1.  Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat.
2.  Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for about 30 seconds.
3.  Add onions, garlic, and ginger to the pot. Saut√© until the onions are golden brown.
4.  Add chicken breast cubes and cook until they turn white on all sides.
5.  Add turmeric powder, coriander powder, red chili powder, and salt. Stir well to coat the chicken.
6.  Add the soaked and drained chana dal to the pot. Stir to combine.
7.  Add the can of diced tomatoes and 4 cups of water to the pot. Mix well.
8.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low and let it simmer for about 45 minutes, or until the chana dal is tender and the chicken is cooked through. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
9.  Once the chana dal is cooked, add garam masala and mix well.
10.  Adjust salt and spices to taste, if necessary.    
11.  Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve hot with rice, roti, or naan.
