Roasted peppers and peanut dip. Inspired by the Arab dip, Muhamara. I like to think of this as a student version of Muhammara with nice traditional ingredients replaced by cheap ones. When I came up with this for a potluck dinner, I decided to name it "Nuhamara" after myself.

Please refer to the [author's notes](https://nchahare.github.io/blog/2022/cooking/) if this is your first time here.

## ingredients 
For 4 portions. 
- 500g of frozen green and red peppers (chopped)
- 200g of peanuts
- 1tsp salt
- 1tsp chilli powder
- 1tbsp garlic powder
- 1tbsp ginger powder
- 1tbsp lemon juice
- 1tbsp tahini
- 100g of breadcrumbs

## steps
1. Fry pepper with peanuts in oil till they are cooked
2. Add garlic, chilli, ginger, salt and mix well
3. After it being cooked, let it cool down
4. Add all of this to a blender along with lemon juice, tahini, and bit of the breadcrumbs
5. Blend it and check the consistency. If you need thicker one, add more breadcrumbs.
