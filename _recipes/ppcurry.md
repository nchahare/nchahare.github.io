title: Palak Paneer
description: Indian cottage cheese and spinach curry
---

Famous vegetarian curry. Some say that paneer, the cottage cheese from India, is chicken for vegetarians. All of the chicken recipes can be made with paneer instead of chicken. I don't agree with this. But it is one of my favorite curries.
Please refer to the [author's notes](https://nchahare.github.io/blog/2022/cooking/) if this is your first time here.

## ingredients
For 4 portions
- 500g baby spinach

## steps

- Add garlic, ginger, and chili, salt one by one
- Add all the dry spices coriander powder, garam masala, and turmeric powder
- Now add the fried cubed cheese and puree spinach. Mix well.
