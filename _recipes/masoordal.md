# Masoor dal
I used to cook only boring supermarket canned cooked lentils for my lunch tuppers. One day, while talking to my mother, I realized I could cook much better dals by replacing canned goods with more interesting legumes, such as masoor dal. The only problem for me here is that I hate soaking lentils in advance. But for good Dal, I will do that.

Please refer to the [author's notes](https://nchahare.github.io/blog/2022/cooking/) if this is your first time here.
